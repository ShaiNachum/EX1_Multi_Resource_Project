# EX1 - Multi Resource Project

## This Project Made During "Advanced Android Development" Course.

## Project Requirement:
  We were asked to build a project that contains two applications that use the same common module.
  In the common module there is an abstract activity from which the activity found in each application is inherited.
  The project must be developed beyond that.
  
## Project Explenation:
  I created memory games, each game will have a different theme.
  One game will be about flags and another will be about symbols of car companies.
